# `ppitables` v0.1.1
This is an updated release of `ppitables` as part of the CRAN submission process. I have implemented the following changes:

accordingly

* I referenced the IPA website in the DESCRIPTION as the developers and maintainers of the PPI tables.

* I cleaned up documentation of each country table to become very informative to user
